# Tracker

This was created a while back to track the discord status that users had and report the amount of minutes they had it before it changed.


Perhaps it is also easier to just create your own requirements.txt file and install dependencies that way. Discord.py is intentionally left out, files are too much for github. 

Lastly there is Heroku code left over. 

Main thing for any users is the index.js above.
